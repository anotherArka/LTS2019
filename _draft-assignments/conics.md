Consider the set of points on the plane satisying an equation

$$ax^2 + 2bxy + cy^2 + dx + ey + f = 0$$

1. Show that there exists a $2\times 2$ symmetric matrix $A$, a row vector $w$ and a constant $C$ such that this equation can be written as

    $$v^TAv + w^Tv + C= 0$$

2. Show that we can choose an orthonormal basis with respect to which the matrix $A$ is diagonal.

3. By considering cases based on the _signs_ ($1$, $-1$ otr $0$) of the diagonal  entries of the diagonal matrix $A$, completing squares, and translating, show that the set is one of
    - an ellipse: $x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 = 1$.
    - a hyperbola: $x^2/a^2 - y^2/b^2 = 1$.
    - a parabola $y = x^2 + c$.
    - a pair of lines (either parallel or intersecting).
    - a line.
    - a point.
    - the empty set.
    - the whole plane.
